# spatstat (transitional, 'umbrella' package)

The original `spatstat` package has now been divided into a family of packages.

The package in this repository
contains almost no code from the original `spatstat` package.
It contains only the documentation, vignettes, and introductory
code for beginners. We call it an umbrella package because when you 
install and load this package, the other members of the family will
also be installed and loaded.

## The new structure of the 'spatstat' family

The `spatstat` package in this repository is represented by the pink box
in the diagram below. The yellow and green boxes are other sub-packages,
and the blue boxes are extension packages.
